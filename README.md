# Simple-AI-ChtaBot
This is a simple chat bot that is trained on a small set of data .....it can be made customizable by changing the .json file
The intents.json file is where the data is - you can add as many tags as you want
The main file is simple bot.py it contains all the logic, model and stuff
All other files are just the data and the model that i have saved so that i don't need to preprocess the data everytime i run the code and also train the model everytime
Just note that all the libraries that are imported in beginning of.py file is installed in your system
Also if u change the .json file make sure u tarin the data again
For any problem u can raise the issue or contact me here
